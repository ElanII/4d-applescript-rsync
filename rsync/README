This is a simple AppleScript based solution which illustates how the UNIX command 'rsync' can be used to sync your 4D application and database.

Mac Only.


Quick Guide

1. On your "server" computer


Install "RSYNC SERVER".
Right click the package and navigate to Contents/Resources/Share.
Copy your application, i.e. 4D.app or 4D Server.app to the "4D" folder.
Copy your database, i.e. DB.4dbase to the "DB" folder. 

That's it!!!

Now, double click RSYNC SERVER.

You will be required to enter your administrator password to start rsync as a daemon.

2. On your "remote" computer


Install "RSYNC CLIENT".
Right click the package and navigate to Contents/Info.plist.
Open with property list editor (if installed) or a text editor.
Make sure the propery key "rsyncServerAddress" corresponds to your server machine.
Make sure the propery key "rsyncAppPath" corresponds to your application path, relative to the "SHARE" directory on the server machine.
Make sure the propery key "rsyncFilePath" corresponds to your document path, relative to the "SHARE" directory on the server machine.
Make sure the propery key "rsyncModuleName" corresponds to the same property on the server side.

The document should normally be a structure file.
4DLink file might work too. (not tested)

Default values are;

rsyncServerAddress = 127.0.0.1
rsyncModuleName = 4D
rsyncAppPath = 4D/4D.app
rsyncFilePath = DB/DB.4dbase/DB.4DB

Note: You should not escape special characters or spaces.

That's it!!!

Now, double click RSYNC CLIENT.

The application and database will be copied to the local disk from the server.
The application will start with the specified document.
Note that the data file is excluded from sync.
This is to prevent rsync from over writing the local data.

As such, on the first instance, you will be prompted to select a data file or create a new one.

If the application or databased needs to be updated, simply update the SHARE folder on the server. 
Each client should receive the latest copy before the next launch.

If a problem occurs during rsync on the client side, the last local copy will be used.

Note: the application and data exist inside the application support folder in the user domain.
